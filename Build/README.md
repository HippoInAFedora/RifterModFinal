# ToDo
Sound Effects
Rework distance indicator (It is not target assisting btw)
Add mastery skin
other stuff I'm probably forgetting.
Ancient Scepter Compatibility

# Ending Notes

Emote compatibility exists, but some animations might look a little jankier than before (I didn't port it properly yet).
