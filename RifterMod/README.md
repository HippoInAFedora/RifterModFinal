and many others. I'll add y'all below.

So what's the build?

## Passives:

> Imperfection

Rifts have the chance to cripple enemies. The chance increases each time an enemy is hit.

> Rift/Fracture

Your shots consist of Rifts and Fracture Lines. Rift are sweet-spot damage at the end of your shot. Primary  shots are connected by weaker Fracture Lines that deal 80% damage that are unable to activate item effects. Rifts are weakened if they hit the ground before max distance.

> Overcharge

Overcharged abilities teleport enemies to your far-range rifts, OR to Timelock if it is out.


## Primary: 

> Focused Rifts

Shoot a far-ranged rift for 500% damage. Hold primary and secondary for a mid-range rift, that is 20% smaller and weaker.

> Buckshot Rifts

Shoot a far-ranged rift for 280% damage (+ 5 x 120% smaller rifts). Hold primary and secondary for a mid-range rift, that is 20% smaller and weaker.
Shoots faster, and has a higher proccing chance than the Focused Rift.


## Secondaries: 

> Fracture Shots

Shoot 3 fracture shots for 80% damage each. Each shot is overcharged.
Let's act like the other secondary doesn't exist.


## Utilities:

> Slipstream

Teleport a short distance. Replenishes secondary skill stock.

> Quantum Portals

Dash back and create two portals, each blasting for 150% damage per second. Portals teleport to each other. (Currently broken in multiplayer).


## Special

> Timelock

Create a field that Nullifies enemies. Hitting the field with a well-placed Rift can cause it to explode, dealing 500% (+100% per enemy hit)!
*while active, all rifts will teleport enemies to the Timelock.


# Ending Notes

Emote compatibility is pending.
New sound effects are pending.
