# ChangeLog
ver 1.0.1
- Mostly a visual update.
- Finalized icons for all moves! Thank you Anartoast once again.
- MainHurtbox origin relocated. This fixes a bug where certain item displays (e.g. oddly shaped opal sphere) were not centered on the character.
- Item displays added for base game and sotv items.
- Ragdoll on death added.
- README corrections.
- I will be working on onHit vfx one of these days...
- Sounds effects are being worked on, but will take some time before any implementation.
- I will try to network the portal soon.

ver 1.0.0
- we calling it full release because WE GOT ANIMAIONS BABYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
- many updated icons by the outstanding Anartoast
- animations by JestAnAnimator. Phenominal
- config cleanup. 

ver 0.5.8
 - wip icons. Anartoast is goated.
 - that's it, I think. Small update.
 
ver 0.5.7
 - double heh. Unlockable should display correctly now (thanks Mightysmallfy for the fix!)
 - portal input adjustments
 - PORTAL IS NOT MULTIPLAYER FRIENDLY. LIFE WILL BE TERRIBLE IF TWO PEOPLE PLAY RIFTER AND HAVE PORTALS. THERE CAN ONLY BE ONE. I'm gonna fix that.

ver 0.5.6
 - portals should not proc on use. Blast around portal still procs.
 - fixed spelling error that TryAgain pointed out, but I couldn't find it again until now.
 - log has minor revisions.

ver 0.5.5
 - New Utility: Quantum Portals. Have fun with it. If it's a hit, I might phase out slipstream
 - Complete rework of teleportation mechanic (totally did not steal Kenko Seamstress code without permission. Thx tho lol)
 - Back vent display mesh removed. It looks much cleaner now.
 
 - roadmap for those interested:
  - Alt abilities, unlock abilities
  - hit effects (and sfx???)
  - skill icons... eventually. Soon or late idk
  - expect at least 3 months for animations to even start
  
  
ver 0.5.4
 - heh

ver 0.5.3
 - updated unlockable token

ver 0.5.2
 - Bug fixes
  - Overlays scale correctly
  - Distance assist logic should be improved, with a midrange color swap
 - Updated skill texts (TryAgain being a goat once again)
 - Added lore
 - Scattered Rift should be an unlcockable now
 - Teleportation is still buggy. Working on it
 - Back vent display improvement

ver 0.5.1
 - Bug fix: rifts now teleport enemies to Timelock if there is one out.
 - Fracture shots recharging if all shots connected was a silly idea. Too silly, even.
 - Removing Chained Worlds for now -- too buggy right now. I want to look at it and fix it in my own time.
 - Figured out why Buckshot wasn't working. It's now working.
 - Some text adjustments.

ver 0.5.0
 - Major Rework!
 - SOTS Compatible!
 - Primary now has a long-range and mid-range distance. Hold Primary and Secondary for the mid-range distance.
 - All New Secondaries!!!
 - Secondary: Fracture Shot - shoot 3 consecutive fracture lines that teleport hit enemies.
 - Secondary Alt: Chained Worlds - shoot up to 5 rifts that teleport enemies to the next. You may recall this used to be a special.
 - All New Special!
 - Special: Timelock - create a space which nullifies all enemies within. If present, enemies will be teleported to the Timelock instead of primary distance. Shooting the Timelock with a Rift will cause it to explode!
 - *Should* be networked. Though it might be finicky.
 - Teleports are inconsistent. I will wait to see if Gearbox update will help with this.
 - I have removed a lot of alts and abilities for this build. If it seems like it's working better, I'll start adding some alts back in and new alts.
 - There is no longer ancient scepter items :(
 - Cripple chance is removed for the time being.

ver 0.4.6
 - RiskOfOptions Support!
 - AncientScepter Support!
 - Shatter reworked. Cripple is our friend now.
 - Updated descriptions.
 - Slipstream and Rift Rider now cleanse debuffs. I kept forgetting to do this. I also didn't test if this works.
 - Gauntlet 25, Scattering has a new mechanic. I will not elaborate.
 - Rifts and Fractures vfx changed once again. This is a neverending story.
 - Distance assist beam should no longer spawn at world 0,0,0 if not in use
 - I should really make this a 0.5.0 update. But I'm reserving that for bigger changes, aka, animations or sfx.
 
 ToDo/Next update, expect:
 - adjust model to be more accurate to vision (the backlight is still being mean to me)
 - unlockables!
 - hitEffects
 


ver 0.4.5
 - MODEL

ver 0.4.4
 - HUD should work only when you're Rifter now.
 
ver 0.4.3
 - rift redesign #3.
 - all rifts have been shrunken a little bit.
 - tracer redesign #2.
 - Experimental HUD overlay added to keep track of overcharge stacks. I have not tested if it is multiplayer compatible. You can disable it in the config (HUD).

ver 0.4.2
 - Small rifts in Buckshot Rift do not apply shatter.
 - No longer destroys tracer is an enemy is teleported or teleporting with Rift Rider.
 - Shatter Icon added
 - small fixes here and there. Hopefully some major fixes... got fixed this time.

ver 0.4.1
 - CONFIG OPTIONS. I have not fully tested if they work entirely, but they exist now.
 - Added "Distance Assist" laser to help visualize primary distance.
 - Buckshot Rift logic improved on small rifts.
 - Buckshot Rift adds more rifts if overcharged.
 - Slipstream angle in air reduced.
 - Temp VFX for Tracer (Woo! Could look terrible)
 - Rift Rider now can stack overcharge if hits enemies.
 - Recursion damage increased from 2200% to 2600%

ver 0.4.0
 - New Primary! Buckshot Rifts
 - Slipstream now moves at an upwards angle if airborne
 - Color scheme on loadout screen
 - bug fixes that I don't remember what they were before
 - Beginning of VFX rework

ver 0.3.0
 - Description changes
 - Specials reworked! Recursion is now a ranged tool, and Chained Worlds acts as god intended (or so I hope).
 - Enemy healthbar now shows the amount of health shattered.
 - May or may not have fixed shatter being applied by non-rifter characters. This needs to be playtested.

ver 0.2.3
 - forgot dll whoops

ver 0.2.2
 - description fixes and changes. (Special thanks to TRYAGAIN211 for the constant help with this!)
 - many a nerf, to compensate for shatter's strengths.
 - secondaries are all at 300%. Changes to percentage will be based on which feels the weakest from here on out.
 - specials were lowered to 280% base damage.
 - this should be the last update for a hot minute. Will be working on VFX, getting a model, etc. Have fun, and let me know how the damage %s feel!


ver 0.2.1
 - Networked!
 - Some slight fixes, Rapidfire is reverted to base stocks of 3, not 4 (it was a mistake)
 - Cooldown increases were made, this was from the last update, forgot to mention
 - Chained Worlds logic is pretty screwy at times. I will work on this, but in the meantime, either avoid it or let me know what situations make it worse.

ver 0.2.0
 - Bug Fix: Rift Rider teleports enemies again.
 - Some Networking has been done. Yay! Not fully networked.
 > Major Changes
 - Base damage has been increased from 12 to 14. This means ALL ability percentages have been tweaked.
 - Rift radius has been reduced for primary and secondary.
 - Added a new experimental passive: Shatter. Currently a hidden debuff (will not count toawrds Deathmark rn).
 - Shatter reduces armor and total health of enemies. Stacks up to 20 times, for a max of 60 armor and 50% health reduction.
 - Armor reduction for shatter is NOT linear; this is used to assist with bosses and spongy enemies.
 - health reduction IS linear. Not that you needed to know either of these.
 - Shatter is not networked currently




ver 0.1.0
 - Bug Fix: Added R2API_DamageType as a dependency. LMK if this isn't working correctly still
 - Bug Fix: Rifts no longer permanently Friendly Fire
 - Bug Fix: All Refraction Rifts now teleport
 - primary rift size slightly increased. Distance slightly decreased.
 - overcharge now stacks (I actually tested it and it works now)
 - Chained Worlds might be buggy, but I think I reverted it
 - issues: Teleporting enemies does not activate if you are not the host player. Working on it.
 - future changes: vfx overhaul, model, anims, you know, the pretty stuff.
 - I only changed it to 0.1.0 cuz I felt like it.

ver 0.0.6
 - slight change. Maybe it worked, maybe it didn't.



ver 0.0.5
 - Yippee! Blacklisting works (lunar is not blacklisted as of currently - for research purposes)
 - Slipstream stacks overcharges (I was lazy, I did not double check, let me know if I'm lying)
 >buffs/nerfs
 - Refraction cooldown changed to 3s.
 - Refraction damage reduced from 375% to 325%. It seems fairly balanced now.
 - Refraction side rifts might not teleport enemies? This is a bug if so. Will change. Let me know.


ver 0.0.4
Eventual Changes:
- blacklisting of lunar enemies, void barnacles, and minor constructs from being teleported
- possible slipstream changes

 >buffs/nerfs
- primary buffed from 550% to 600%
- refraction now always teleports
- recursion buffed to 350% base damage



ver 0.0.3
- Got rid of my lazy implementation of passives that aren't showing up anyways (they were breaking things, apparently (hopefully))


ver 0.0.2
- I intended to add basic vfx for visual clarity. I am leaving that for later (if you want to do this, let me know!)
- Made it so other skills cannot be used during Recursion.
- Fixed Rift Rider getting cancelled by everything.
  >buffs/nerfs
- primary buffed from 450% to 550%
- Refraction buffed from 375% to 475% (I'm too lazy to change the logic right now, so I'm testing this first)

- Initial build
